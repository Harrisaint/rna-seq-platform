# RNA-Seq Platform Development Progress

## Current Status
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17 13:35
**Current Phase:** Initial Setup & Analysis

## Project Overview
RNA-Seq analysis platform with web interface, API backend, and automated pipeline processing.

## Recent Work Completed
- [x] Project structure analysis
- [x] Identified main components: web frontend, API backend, Snakemake pipeline
- [x] Created progress tracking system
- [x] Fixed Demo Dataset section background color to match Overview title blue for better visibility
- [x] Updated Demo Dataset background to use exact hex color #90caf9 to match Overview title blue perfectly

## Current Focus
- Setting up comprehensive progress tracking for context preservation between chat sessions
- Analyzing existing codebase structure and functionality

## Key Files & Components

### Frontend (web-new/)
- React + TypeScript application
- Components: Heatmap, VolcanoPlot, PCAPlot, MAPlot, StatCard
- Pages: Overview, QC, Expression, Differential, Explorer, Pathways
- API client for backend communication

### Backend (api/)
- FastAPI application
- Main modules: main.py, schemas.py, utils.py
- Docker containerized
- Deployed configuration (render.yaml)

### Pipeline (Snakefile)
- Snakemake workflow for RNA-Seq analysis
- QC processing, differential expression analysis
- Results stored in results/ directory

### Data
- Sample metadata in data/metadata/
- Configuration files in config/
- Environment specifications in envs/

## Next Steps
1. Complete progress tracking system setup
2. Analyze current functionality gaps
3. Identify improvement opportunities
4. Plan development roadmap

## Technical Notes
- Project uses multiple technologies: React, FastAPI, Snakemake, R
- Both old (web/) and new (web-new/) frontend versions exist
- Pipeline results are JSON-formatted for web consumption

## Issues & Blockers
- None currently identified

## Commands & Scripts
- `start_services.bat` / `start_services.ps1` - Start development services
- `run_continuous_pipeline.sh` - Run analysis pipeline
- `Makefile` - Build automation
